## üéØ Introduction
The project focuses on solving the challenge of hyper-personalized financial product recommendations while also leveraging Generative AI and multi-modal data processing (text, images, and voice) to provide tailored financial insights based on user profiles, transaction history, sentiment analysis, and behavioral patterns. The primary goal is to move beyond traditional, generic financial advice and create an AI-driven digital financial advisor that dynamically adapts to users' evolving needs. The system utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Mistral AI, Hugging Face models) for intelligent financial recommendations, while multi-modal input processing enhances personalization through document analysis and future voice-based interactions.

Our solution employs a sophisticated dual-agent architecture: the first agent focuses on understanding the user through a comprehensive onboarding process, while the second agent delivers customized content and product recommendations based on this personalized profile. This approach ensures that each user receives relevant financial advice aligned with their unique circumstances and goals.

Key technical components include a FastAPI backend, MongoDB for data storage, and a real-time recommendation engine using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The system ensures data security and compliance with financial privacy standards, while emphasizing ethical AI practices, explainability, and transparency in all user interactions. This project aims to revolutionize digital banking by providing highly personalized, AI-driven financial planning, ultimately enhancing user engagement, financial literacy, and decision-making through a smart, adaptive chatbot.

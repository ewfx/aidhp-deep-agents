# Multi-Modal Financial Advisor Chatbot

## Overview
The **Multi-Modal Financial Advisor Chatbot** is a cutting-edge solution designed to offer **hyper-personalized financial product recommendations**. Developed as part of the **Wells Fargo AI/DHP Developer Acceleration Hackathon**, this chatbot leverages **Generative AI techniques** and **multi-modal inputs** (text, images, and voice) to dynamically tailor financial advice based on user profiles, historical transaction data, sentiment analysis, and real-time behavioral inputs.

The solution employs a sophisticated **dual-agent architecture** where an onboarding agent first deeply understands the user's financial situation, goals, and preferences, followed by an advisory agent that delivers customized content and product recommendations. This approach ensures highly relevant and personalized advice for each user.
